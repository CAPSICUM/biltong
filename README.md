jsplumb-geom
============

Geometry functions used internally by jsPlumb. Perhaps useful for other people. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of functions: these are things that jsPlumb needs and nothing else.  In the interests of avoiding bloat in jsPlumb, it is unlikely that anything jsPlumb does not need will find its way into this project.
